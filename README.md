# GameVault: Time-Locked NFT Gaming Rewards

---

## Project Overview
GameVault is a decentralized gaming rewards system built on top of the Soundness layer. It allows players to earn, store, and unlock NFT-based rewards over time. By leveraging time-lock mechanisms, we ensure fair play, scarcity, and long-term engagement for gamers. Players will receive exclusive NFTs for completing in-game challenges or achieving milestones, which are securely stored and can only be claimed after a predefined period.

## Features
- **Time-Locked NFTs:** Rewards are locked until specific conditions are met (time, achievements, or milestones).  
- **Proof-of-Play Verification:** Uses Soundness CLI to validate that achievements are genuinely earned.  
- **Secure Storage:** All NFTs and rewards are securely stored on-chain, ensuring transparency and tamper-proof access.  
- **Social Integration:** Players can showcase unlocked rewards and rare NFTs on their profiles, increasing community engagement.

## Benefits
- Increases player retention and long-term engagement in games.  
- Encourages fair competition by validating achievements with Soundness proofs.  
- Provides a unique NFT-based economy for gamers and developers.  
- Fully open-source and extendable for other gaming projects.

## Implementation Details
GameVault leverages **Soundness CLI** to manage proofs and verifications of in-game achievements. The backend uses a combination of **smart contracts** and **off-chain indexing** for NFT storage. Rewards are minted as NFTs that can be claimed only after a time-lock period is complete. Developers can fork and extend GameVault to integrate their own games or build new reward systems on top of the Soundness layer.

## Future Extensions
- **Cross-Game Rewards:** Link rewards across multiple games for a unified NFT gaming economy.  
- **Dynamic Challenges:** Integrate real-time game challenges with automated proofs.  
- **Marketplace:** Enable players to trade or auction time-locked NFTs once unlocked.
